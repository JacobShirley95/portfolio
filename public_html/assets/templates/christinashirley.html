<p><a class="block" href="http://christinashirley.co.uk">View site</a></p>

<p>This is a website I made for my mum who works as a childminder.<p>
<p>
    Designing this website I wanted to give a fun theme suited to young children.
    For this I used bright colours and interspersed pictures of the children or
    of things they had made, and a handwritten font.
