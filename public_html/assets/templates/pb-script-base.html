<h2>Powerbot Script Base</h2>
<p><a class="block" href="https://github.com/JacobShirley95/pb-script-base">GitHub</a></p>
<p>This projects provides a foundation on which scripts can be created for Powerbot.
    It is intended to only include very loose and generic classes which can be used to make a variety of tasks easier.
</p>

<p>The base itself uses a State machine to allow code to be separated and allow operations to inherit from each other.</p>
