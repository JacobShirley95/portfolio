ECollision is a basic elastic/inelastic collision simulation library that I made for my final year A Level project.
It is designed to help students understand the laws of energy conservation and momentum by controlling the velocity and radius
of particles in the simulation.

<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>ECollision is a basic elastic/inelastic collision simulation library that I made for my final year A Level project.
It is designed to help students understand the laws of energy conservation and momentum by controlling the velocity and radius
of particles in the simulation.
</p>
<p>ECollision has gone through many iterations over the years since I left sixth-form. It was firstly written in ES5 JavaScript,
    but I then decided to move over to CoffeeScript, as this has better support for a class syntax.
    It is currently being ported to the ES6 version of JavaScript, which is now on par with CoffeeScript in features.
</p>
<p>The rendering of the particles is done by a library called EaselJS. I chose to use StageGL instead of Stage as it uses the WebGL capabilities of the browser (hardware acceleration) to speed up the rendering porcess. I have also tried to keep the rendering and logic as separate of possible, meaning anyone can use this library headless as well.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Separate logic and rendering</li>
    <li>Hardware acceleration</li>
    <li>Accurate physics behavior</li>
    <li>Demos featuring a graph and other information about the simulation</li>
</ul>
<h3>TO DO</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
